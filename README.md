# BeeBarber

## A VR-based Haircutting Simulation Game 

## This README is now deprecated, Please checkout our documentation file.

### Intro
BeeBarber is a VR application to let users experience being a bee flying around customersâ€™ heads and doing the haircut for the customers. The application will try to simulate what happens in a barber store but from a perspective of a bee. We allow our beebarber to control the razor, clipper, and other tools. The application is mainly for users to experience hair cutting and playing with a drone at the same time. Still, it could potentially have the educational purpose of letting people learn how to do the haircut in a private and safe environment without hurting others and themselves. 

### State of art
Not quite decent now.... What we have now is something like VR fruit ninja. We havenot build a head or something but that will be done soon.....

### Future
We will also have some fancy features in our big pictures, such as real-time physical hair simulation if we finish other basic functionality earlier than expected. Finally, we will also have a feeding mode that allows players to pour or shoot honey into customers' mouths. It will be a fun and innovative project entirely on VR.
